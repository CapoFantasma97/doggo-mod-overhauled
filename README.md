# **Doggo Mod Overhauled**
Doggo Mod Overhauled is a mod that just makes dogs better by adding personality, dog bowls for dogs to eat from and a little tennis ball to play fetch.  
It is a complete rewrite of the mod [Doggo Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/doggo-mod "Doggo Mod") and fixes various bugs.

You can also rename a dog bowl in an anvil to give it a name.  
Only dogs with matching names will eat from it.

To break it, you need at least a stone pickaxe.

### <ins>Tennis Ball</ins>:
A small toy for your dog to play with.  
You can throw it by right-clicking it. (Though be careful when you're near glass panes)

## **Behavior and personality**
### <ins>Digging</ins>
From time to time a dog may start digging. Give it some time and it may find some treasure. (But I wouldn't be the one expecting diamonds or netherite)

### <ins>Healing</ins>
There are two ways to heal a dog:  
1. Place down a dog bowl and put food (preferably meat) in it by right-clicking on the dog bowl. If a dog is near a dog bowl and it's not on max health, it will try eating from it.  
2. You can give food (preferably meat) to a dog by right-clicking on it. The dog will then hold it in its mouth and eat whenever it wants to.

### <ins>Holding an item</ins>
A dog can hold an item in its mouth at any time. Dogs prefer food over weapons in case you want your dog to become a warrior.

### <ins>Napping</ins>
If you leave a dog sitting and walk a way, it will lay down and take a nap.

From time to time a dog may scratch its ear.
