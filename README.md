You can also rename a dog bowl in an anvil to give it a name.  
Only dogs with matching names will eat from it.

### Digging
From time to time a dog may start digging. Give it some time and it may find some treasure. (But I wouldn't be the one expecting diamonds or netherite)

### Healing
There are two ways to heal a dog:  
Place down a dog bowl and put food (preferably meat) in it by right-clicking on the dog bowl. If a dog is near a dog bowl and it's not on max health, it will try eating from it.  
You can give food (preferably meat) to a dog by right-clicking on it. The dog will then hold it in its mouth and eat whenever it wants to.

### Holding an item
A dog can hold an item in its mouth at any time. Dogs prefer food over weapons in case you want your dog to become a warrior.
### Napping
If you leave a dog sitting and walk a way, it will lay down and take a nap.
